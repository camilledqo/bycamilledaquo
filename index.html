   <h3>Discover a retro universe</h3>
   <p>An oasis away from the crowd, designed with modernity for an icon whose name we would have forgotten. A furiously audacious setting in which memories, velvet exoticism and pieces from another time are nestled. A cinematic place where materials and volumes reign supreme, ideal for presenting our latest creations.

<h3>Our previous collections:</h3>
<div class="cards">
	<div class="card-white">
		<img src="images/milan.jpeg" alt="">
		<h6>The Milanese style</h6>
		<p>Milanese interiors have that theatrical extravagance that inspires us at The Socialite Family. A taste for patterns and color that our artistic director Constance Gennari infuses throughout our collections so that you, in turn, can embody your Milanese jewel box.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="card-white">
		<img src="images/manifesto.jpeg" alt="">
		<h6>MANIFESTO</h6>
		<p>New creations alongside iconic ones with sophisticated new finishes that set the scene. A soft and harmonious universe that temporizes this return from the frantic pace of vacation.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="card-white">
		<img src="images/rive.jpeg" alt="">
		<h6>RIVE GAUCHE</h6>
		<p>A change of scenery and light as soothing as the atmosphere imposed by the latest models developed by our design studio. A set of warm references that complement each other as much as they balance each other, thanks to a play of finishes that blows hot and cold.</p>
